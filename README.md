## Game Overview
Kapacity is a puzzle-solving game where you manage electrical components to ensure all devices are powered without causing overloads. The game features a variety of levels, each with unique circuit layouts and challenges.

## Gameplay
- Players are given different electrical components like wires, switches, resistors, and capacitors.
- The goal is to connect these components to power up devices, such as bulbs or motors, without exceeding the maximum capacity of the circuit.
- As players progress, levels become more challenging with complex circuits and limited resources.

## Features
- **Challenging puzzles:** 50+ levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Multiple components:** Use resistors, capacitors, wires, and other components to solve puzzles.
- **Dynamic difficulty:** As players advance, new types of components and circuit challenges are introduced.
- **Hints system:** Get help when you're stuck, but use hints wisely!

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [Kapacity GitHub repository](https://github.com/YourUsername/Kapacity).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
